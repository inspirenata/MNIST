MNIST_data_classifying

A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a feedforward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using backpropagation. I have focused on making the code
simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.
